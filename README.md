## Old-gold-pnjabi-songs

This project is react + redux + firebase project. This web app is a complete CRUD application. Backend is firebase.

As the name suggests, it is an entertainment app. It plays songs for the user. There are only songs of four singers right now, but I can be extended to more songs, just changing data in the backend (firebase). 

All the firebase operations are done with the help of redux actions. Firebase SDK is used for all CRUD operations. Firebase SDK is available as an NPM package. There are routes in this app. For routes, a react-router-dom package is used.

For database security firebase rules are used.
